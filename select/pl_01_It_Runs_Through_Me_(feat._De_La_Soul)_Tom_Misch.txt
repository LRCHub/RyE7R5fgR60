I love the way it flows
I love the way it grows
There's something
in this sound that takes me far
It's like a special song
Can move my mood along
But I cannot say you'll
hear through my guitar
She told me add a bassline
And everything will be alright
She told me
that the groove is mine
It will take us
through the night
And where I'll go
Can't explain I’ll never know
But it's beautiful
You can't take this away from me
The way I hit a melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can't take this away from me
The way I hit a melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
I love the way it sings
All the joy that it brings
Remember skating down the road
towards the park?
I can never say no
You with that summer glow
The music gives me sun
when winter starts
She told me add a bassline
And everything will be alright
She told me
that the beat is mine
It will rock us
through the night
And where I'll go
Can't explain I’ll never know
But it's beautiful
You can't take this away from me
(oh)
The way I hit a melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can't take this away from me
(oh)
The way I hit a melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can't take this away from me
(oh)
The way I hit a melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can't take this away from me
(oh)
The way I hit a melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
(Just running through me)
Yo, I wear notes like coats
Blues like doos,
warm from the rhythm,
soul that glues
That bounce to my bones,
that jazz in my spine
The hop is my home,
rap is my grind
I'm grindin'on the back side
of life, we dance
She threw me a chance,
her hands in my pants
Actually,
my pockets holdin' me tight,
whispering a dream
I could hold in the night
Look tight, a rhythm
that's throbbin' my veins
Wake up and write it on a pad,
the pains
Like church,
the organ will invite the tears
Like birth, I'm cryin',
let you know I'm here
Held by the song
that gave me a name
Dressed by the verse
that gave me a claim
(There's just a bass
in the line)
safe to inhale
And if you live well
Then longer years in this state,
you will be
A timeless octave to play
for the tree
That's rooted
in every single nerve in me
The nerve of he
who ignores the key
And use it to open the minds
that be free
Whenever you're hot head
pours you a breeze
Beneath the clouds,
you allowed to see,
in clarity, through harmony
Someone harmin' me?
That won't be done
I stand protected
by the laws of fun
I am perfected
through the rhymes of Run
Walkin' this way
and leave the party stunned
This music, it launched me
With no aim,
I've landed with some plane
Where I am I can't explain
or ever know
But it's beautiful so...
You can't take this away from me
The way I hit a melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
(come on, yo)
You can't take this away from me
Oh, the way I hit a melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
