```lrc
[00:02.15] One, two, three, four
[00:12.65] 
[00:23.82] I love the way it flows
[00:26.47] I love the way it grows
[00:29.01] There's something in this sound that takes me far
[00:33.77] It's like a special song
[00:36.28] Can move my mood along
[00:38.79] But I cannot say you'll hear through my guitar
[01:01.79] 
[00:43.48] She told me add a bassline
[00:45.80] And everything will be alright
[00:48.43] She told me that the groove is mine
[00:50.82] It will take us through the night
[00:53.22] And where I'll go
[00:57.59] Can't explain I'll never know
[01:00.70] But it's beautiful
[01:09.70] 
[01:03.06] You can't take this away from me
[01:05.55] The way I hear the melody
[01:07.85] The waves bring clarity
[01:10.55] Running through me
[01:12.99] You can't take this away from me
[01:15.43] The way I hear the melody
[01:17.83] The waves bring clarity
[01:20.44] Running through me
[01:29.44] 
[01:22.49] I love the way it sings
[01:25.24] All the joy that it brings
[01:28.01] Remember skating down the road towards the park?
[01:32.53] I can never say no
[01:34.93] You with that summer glow
[01:38.18] The music gives me sun when winter starts
[01:58.68] 
[01:42.78] She told me add a bassline
[01:45.06] And everything will be alright
[01:47.89] She told me that the beat is mine
[01:50.13] It will rock us through the night
[01:52.78] And where I'll go
[01:55.56] Can't explain I'll never know
[01:59.96] But it's beautiful
[02:08.96] 
[02:02.33] You can't take this away from me (oh)
[02:04.96] The way I hear the melody
[02:07.45] The waves bring clarity
[02:09.91] Running through me
[02:12.37] You can't take this away from me (oh)
[02:14.88] The way I hear the melody
[02:17.31] The waves bring clarity
[02:19.78] Running through me
[02:28.78] 
[02:22.55] You can't take this away from me (oh)
[02:25.02] The way I hear the melody
[02:27.33] The waves bring clarity
[02:29.81] Running through me (c'mon y'all)
[02:32.18] You can't take this away from me (oh)
[02:34.10] The way I hear the melody
[02:37.40] The waves bring clarity
[02:39.80] Running through me (yeah, it's runing through me)
[03:04.30] 
[02:42.23] Yo, I wear notes like coats
[02:44.83] Blues like doos, warm from the rhythm, soul that glues
[02:48.38] That bounce to my bones, that jazz in my spine
[02:50.75] The hop is my home, rap is my grind
[02:53.24] I'm grindin' on the backside of life, we dance
[02:55.71] She threw me a chance, her hands in my pants
[02:58.30] Actually, my pockets holdin' me tight
[03:00.62] Whispering a dream I could hold in the night
[03:22.62] 
[03:03.29] Blood tight, a rhythm that's throbbin' my veins
[03:05.56] Wake up and write it on a pad, the pains
[03:08.13] Like church, the organ will invite the tears
[03:10.51] Like birth, I'm cryin', let you know I'm here
[03:12.93] Held by the song that gave me a name
[03:15.50] Dressed by the verse that gave me a claim
[03:17.97] (There's just a bass in the line) safe to inhale
[03:41.97] 
[03:20.45] And if you live well
[03:21.95] Belonger years in this state, you will be
[03:24.42] A timeless octave to play for the tree
[03:26.75] That's rooted in every single nerve in me
[03:29.21] The nerve of he who ignores the key
[03:31.69] And use it to open the mind to be free
[03:34.26] Whenever you're hot head ignores you, you are free
[03:36.79] Beneath the clouds, you allowed to see, in clarity
[04:01.79] 
[03:40.24] Through harmony, someone harmin' me?
[03:42.69] That won't be done
[03:44.12] I stand protected by the laws of fun
[03:46.46] I am perfected through the rhymes of Run
[03:48.96] Walkin' this way and leave the party stunned
[03:51.42] This music, it launched me
[03:53.75] With no aim, I've landed with some plane
[03:57.16] Where I am, I can't explain or never know
[04:00.14] But it's beautiful so-
[04:11.14] 
[04:01.68] You can't take this away from me
[04:03.64] The way I hear the melody
[04:06.19] The waves bring clarity
[04:08.63] Running through me (c'mon y'all)
[04:11.14] You can't take this away from me
[04:13.59] The way I hear the melody
[04:16.06] The waves bring clarity
[04:18.44] Running through me
